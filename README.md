# Leafmap-FAF

This is an example of creating interactive maps in a Jupyter environment using leafmap Python package with just a few lines of code. 

Using leafmap package, it becomes easy and fast to load a multipolygon layer, or generate a choropleth map based on the value of a data field (or variable). You can even create, edit and save a vector layer directly on the map in a Jupyter environment.

The data from Freight Analysis Framework is used for the demonstration. 

FAF_Zones: shapefile for FAF zones

centroid.CSV : FAF zone centroid locations

faf4_zone2.json: JSON file for FAF zones

od_mode_vol_45.CSV: Origin-destination flows by mode, including tons (000) and $ values (millions)
